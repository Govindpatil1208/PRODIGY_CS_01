# PRODIGY_CS_01 - Caesar Cipher 🔐

This is a simple Python project to implement the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm for both encryption and decryption.

---

## 📌 Task Description

Create a Python program that can:
- 🔒 Encrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- 🔓 Decrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Let users input a message and a shift value

---

## 🧠 How Caesar Cipher Works?

Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:
- `A` becomes `D`
- `B` becomes `E`
- and so on...

## 🚀 How to Run the Program

### ✅ Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed. Then:

```bash
python "Implement Caesar.py"
